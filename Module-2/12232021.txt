flex - dynamic property to account for how someone changes the viewport
    flex: flex-grow flex-shrink flex-basis; / default flex: 2 1 30em;
    flex-basis: initial main size of flex item, default width property - synonomous with width / can set to percent (20%) to fill the row
    flex-grow: specifies how much of the remaining space should be assigned to the item

    grow - if more width were to become available, what do i do with this element?
    flex: 1 1 200px; (share space evenly)
    flex: 2 1 30em; (2 is twice as big as siblings)
    flex: 0 0 400px; (fixed width at 400px, as the viewport changes, keep it at 400)
