This Week: Advanced Class

mobile responsive - mobile devices come in all shapes and sizes - create a singular flow for all screen sizes
media queries - targeting specific breakpoints for screen size width

UI/UX building apps people want to use, high fidelity prototypes, detailied CSS and javascript
    (front end web dev)

designs - dribble, awawards, - see something cool online and "bring it to life"
    used some code someone else provides: cite and credit
        borrow photos and use them: cite and 
    design or wireframe layout: using as an inspiration is more emulation vs plagarism
    but you cant reuse code thats somewhere online


wireframe - skeleton of the layout, tools (adobe xd, figma, indesign, slides, diagram.net, photoshop)

semantic html tags - header, content, footer, entry
    header, nav, section, article, details, aside, footer
    follow convention of where you work

CSS classes vs IDs
 - IDs are specific 
 - classes are for all purpose, reusable styles


CSS Flexbox 
a layout model that allows elements to align and distribute space within a container
display: flex, block, inline, inline-block, none (useful in dynamic ui (form disappearing))
used in contrast to float and display properties

flex: wrap; - wrap around the item
flex-direction: column or row;

align-items (top and bottom) (vertical)
justify-content (left and right) (horizontal is a longer word)
