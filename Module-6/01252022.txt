another word for server-side APIs - REST APIs

Week 6 Challenge - Weather Dashboard - third party APIs
    using fetch requests to fetch weather data for a particular city
    making requests to openweather api - use jsonformatter to see api and inspect response
    past searches populate on left hand side
        query a city - hits openweather api, then parse and present in nice format
    1. todays forecast - with icons included with API
    2. 5-Day forecast - 5 blocks with weather horizontally

Project
    use at least 2 apis and create something novel
    usual format requirements
    NO bootstrap

query parameters - query specific info from api / database
    at the very end of a full URL
    everything to the right
    limit to how long URL can be - (really really long)
    api endpoint - place where actual data will come back to us

asynchronous programming - means it's "in time"
    promises - syntax to use is .then(callback)
    first make a promise with JS - .then()
        when fetch request is done, then ....

Another syntax -
