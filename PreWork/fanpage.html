      <h1>The cat, commonly known as Buggle Wuggle, is one of the most popular musicians in the world today.</h1>
      <p> <!--paragraph marker, wraps text into block-->
          I love the sound of her cat voice. It's distinguished, and it is <i>full</i> of personality.
      </p>
      <h2>What is there to like about her?...More like what's <i><em>NOT</em></i> to like about her!</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>She has a wide vocal range of meows.</li>
          <li>Some of her meows are long, while others are short.</li>
          <li>She is <em>very</em> experimental with her song choices, and she breaks boundaries with the length and tone of her vocal genius.</li>
      </ul>
