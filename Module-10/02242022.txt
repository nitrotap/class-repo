Class Notes

Mock 
    replace something we don't control with something that we do
    3 steps:
        spyOn(<functionName>, "<functionMethod>") - to mock and spy the console.log method
        mockImplementation(<function to implement OR empty>) - 
            mock.mockImplementation(() => { });
        mockRestore() - 

    const mock = jest.spyOn(console, "log"); // a way for jest to reroute output from code we are testing 
        // an object that will give you all the details from which you attempted to call it
        
    const mock = jest.spyOn(console, "log");
    mock.mockImplementation(() => { }); // empty bc not manipulating
    mock.mockRestore()


Class inheritance for class assignment
    if a child inherits from parent class (class Rectangle extends Shape)
        then you can have different input parameters 
    in the child class, use super(params) to supply inputs for the parent class
        need to use super to make sure to send the parent class it's needed parameters
    




The static keyword defines a static method or property for a class. Static members (properties and methods) are called without instantiating their class and cannot be called through a class instance.
