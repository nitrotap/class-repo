Module 3 notes

creating a function
function FUNCTION-NAME(String args) {
    // do the below code
    window.alert("YOUR STRING")
}

calling a function
FUNCTION-NAME();

setting a variable
var VARIABLE-NAME = "Tony the Robot"

JavaScript has 7 data types 
    boolean(T/F), null, undefined, number (<= 2^53 - 1), bigint (>= 2^53), string (set of characters) , symbol (key)
    objects- 

comments in JavaScript 
    // for single line
    /* for multiple line */

console.log(YOUR-LOGGED-DATA); - sets up the dom to log anything in the parnethesis
    Web API - an object, like window, with its own set of functions and properties
    can see the logged items in chrome devtools

String concatenation
    just use +

creating a function
    function declaration - using function keyword
    function expression - create a function by assigning it to a variable

scoping - "scoping a variable" - creating a new variable with the same name inside a function

variable-to-be-stored = use-actual-value-variable-holds-currently

don't confuse strings containing numbers with the integer data type

state - the data in our application at a specific point in time

conditions - checks on the status of the code
if (YOUR-CONDITION) {
    // do this code
} else if (SECOND-CONDITION) {
    // do this code instead of the first block
} else { // no need for a condition since this is the default
    // do this code instead of the other blocks
}

control flow - type of statement that sets a variable and uses conditions on the variable

edge cases - situations where the user inputs unexpected data

|| - OR operator
=== - equals operator
&& - AND operator

if conditions can be boolean
    empty string "", null, 0 are false, any other string is true

3.2.3
Psuedocode - description of steps that an algorithm or application must complete

array in JavaScript
     - store data as a list
     - arrayName[position of element - 1]
     - arrayName[arrayNames.length - 1] will return last element of an array
     
primitive data holds only one value (string, number, boolean) vs objects (arrays, etc) that hold more than one value of data

for in JavaScript
    for([initial expression]; condition; [increment expression]) {
        statement
    }
    for (var i = 0; i < array[index]; i++) {
        statement
    }
    for (starting at 0; going until the index element in the array; going up one by one) {
        this code will run for every element, starting at 0, going to index specified, one by one;
    }

while (condition) {
    statement
}
