Big O is just the output from the computation
    how runtime will scale as input size increases

Want to be below O(n)


digital signal processing - what powers electronic communication
    - 


add element to start of array - unshift()


scope - pertains to the visibility of variables
    - "see" that a variable is declared
context - refers to the object to which a function belongs

JS - Global Execution Context
    - All of the global code i.e. code which is not inside any function or object is executed inside the global execution context.
    - abstract container by Js engine to hold info about global environment

Functional Execution Context
    - environment a function is executed in
    - execution stack runs global execution first, then functional executions as they come up


Closures
The members of an object are all PUBLIC members. Any function can access, modify, or delete those members, or add new members. There are two main ways of putting members in a new object. In the constructor and in the prototype.

PRIVATE members are made by the constructor. Ordinary vars and parameters of the constructor become the private members.

A PRIVILEGED method is able to access the private variables and methods, and is itself accessible to the public methods and the outside. 

This pattern of public, private, and privileged members is possible because JavaScript has CLOSURES, when an inner function always has access to the vars and parameters of its outer function, even after the outer function has returned. 

This is an extremely powerful property of the language! 


closure - inner function with an outer function that allows inner variables to be private


stack - only allow access to top element
    an abstraction of how data can be arranged
    lifo - last in first out
    not natively supported in JavaScript
    needs to have pop

queues 
    - only allow access to first element
    - FIFO, first in, first out
