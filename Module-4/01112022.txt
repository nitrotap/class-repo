Class Notes

lexical scoping - when the scope of the variable is determined by the structure of the program, - or static scoping
dynamic scoping - bound by its most recent assigned value


API - application programming interface
    - all purpose term, toolkit, 

submit a challenge - can always to back to regrade
    - just absorb main concepts and move on
    - not perfection, proficiency

have at least started the module before first class on Tuesday
    - 

Challenge Assignment - quiz app
    - keeps track of click events, on click, tracks if question is correct or incorrectly


window.document (aka the DOM)
    - an object - the page in a way we can interate with it using JavaScript
    - nodes are organized in a tree. each element is a node.
    - with JavaScript, you can maniuplate web pages

.createElement("element") - makes an element in the web page
    - only lives in JavaScript until appendChild is called
.setAttribute() - 
.appendChild() - actually adds the content to the page

"virtual element" - before an html element added to the page using .createElement()

hex color values - only need first 3
    gray - #333, #666, #888, #999

.append() vs .appendChild()
    .appendChid() - Node.appendChid() - ONLY 1 at a time
    .append() - Element.append() - more flexible, can do multiple at once
        listEl.append("<li> pizza for life </li>");

event listeners - have JavaScript waiting for an event to happen
    - have code execute when some event happens
    var button = document.querySelector(#button)";
    button.addEventListener("click", function() {
        // do something on click
        // anonymous function or named function
    });

event is often abbreviated as "e" or "evt"
for full control, use event.preventDefault(); - prevent page from doing some strange default behaviour

top of script files are the variables
