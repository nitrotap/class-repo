Class Notes


node.js

open source js runtime environment


can't use arrow functions for object methods or event handlers

const and let are block scoped
    let - when a value will need to be reassigned
    const whenever a value won't need to be reassigned


Truthy/Falsy
Six Falsy Types - undefined, null, NaN (not a number, 0,
    "", false

Truthy
    any object or kind of object
    boolean(false) is Truthy?

Template literals
    embed JS expressions in text
    to embed some value, ${js within curly braces}

npm
    free hosted library where anyone can publish code
    inquirer.js
        npm -v
        npm --version
        npm init - has you fill out a bunch of values
        npm init -y - makes it for you
        npm -i <package name>
        npm install <package name>
        npm ls
    all creates package.json / package-lock.json (exact version of different things)
        a lot of times, .gitignore package-lock.json and node modules
            ALWAYS gitignore node modules
            because theres a lot of data that aren't necessary
            never send up to repo - can just send others the list of dependencies (package-lock.json)

fs - file store
var fs = require('fs')
    fs.writeFile('./output.txt')
