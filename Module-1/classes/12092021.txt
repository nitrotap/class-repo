Slack Set-up
    add social links to social-links (github, linkedin)
    add apps - AskBCS Learning Assistant - one of the most useful things in the class
    applications we will be using 
    please use threads when conversing about a particular topic
    everyone in the industry uses slack for something (90%)
    slack backtick - like apostrophe - 3 will block code
        2 will create a variable
    /snippet - create a snippet
    screenshots - 
        for mac 
            command + shift + 4
            ctrl command shift 4 (to clipboard)

VSCode - integrated development environment
    prettier - code formatter
    format on save 
    file > auto save (make sure its checked)


gitlab vs github  
    course content on gitlab
    github - post repos for assignments
    repo (repository) - folder to host a project
    git is source control software
    git (a disagreeable ornery person)

heroku - host apps for free

github - create repo  
    add readme
    add gitignore to 

github bash
    pwd - where i am
    ls - list the folders, where i can go
    mkdir make directory
    cd change directory (cd .. is parent directory)
    open
    touch - create file
    rm - remove file

    GitHub Clone
    go to code then clone repo
        git clone "https://github......"

using and interacting with Git from terminal
    git status
    git add . 
    git commit -m'this is my awesome commit'
    git push origin main


Setting up your first GitHub repo:
On github.com create a new repo, give it a name like my_first_repo. add a readme and a gitignore if you want.
On the repo page, click Code and copy the https link

On Windows, open up Git Bash. Sorry don't have a mac.

Code to set up your github repo:
First, figure out where you want to save the repo - I'm using my desktop
cd /c/users/(yourusername)/desktop/

Second, make the new folder for your coding folder
mkdir /c/users/(yourusername/desktop/(yourfoldername)

Third, clone your github repo into your coding folder by going to Github.com 
git clone "https://github.com...whatever your repo link is from github.com"

Fourth, change your working directory to your cloned repo folder
cd /c/users/(yourusername)/desktop/(yourfoldername)/(yourreponame)

Fifth, check the status of the git
git status

Next, add a file (a change to the version control)
touch myFile.txt

Then, add the changes to the version control
git add

Afterwards, "commit" the changes to the version control with a comment (what you did)
git commit -m'I created an empty file as a demonstration'

Finally, push your computer code to the internet(github)
git push origin main


Git Bash Code:
cd /c/users/(yourusername)/desktop/
mkdir /c/users/(yourusername/desktop/(yourfoldername)
git clone "https://github.com...whatever your repo link is from github.com"
cd /c/users/(yourusername)/desktop/(yourfoldername)/(yourreponame)
git status
touch myFile.txt
git add
git commit -m'this is my awesome commit'
git push origin main
